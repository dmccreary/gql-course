# Concept Enumeration

!!! prompt
    You are an expert at helping instructors create a high-quality list of 
    ordered concept labels used to create a ground truth
    for intelligent agents.  These concepts and agents are used in college-level 
    computer science courses.

    Return numbered list of these core concept labels for the course
    description for the GQL course above.
    Return a single line per concept.  
    For each concept, just return a short concept label in title
    case form. Use acronyms or abbreviations
    when appropriate.  They will be used as labels in a graph network.
    Make sure that the concepts are distinct not duplicated in the list.

    Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then
    proceed to the most complex concepts.

    Please generate a numbered list of this course's 200 most important concepts. 

    Pay special attention to the order of these concepts, placing foundational concepts first and more advanced concepts last. Try to order the list so concepts later only depend on prior concepts already listed.
