# Concept Enumeration

!!! prompt
    You are an expert at helping instructors create a high-quality list of ordered concept labels for teaching courses. You use the 2001 Bloom taxonomy to order concepts from foundational to concepts where students generate their queries. 

    The ISO standards organization just created a new standard for queries on labeled property graphs. This new standard query language is called the "Graph Query Language" or GQL. The full standard is described in ISO/IEC 39075, released in April 2024. 

    I would like to teach a course on this new language but I need your help getting a list of concepts that should be taught in this course and in what order they should be taught. Here are some of the goals of this course: 

    1. Understand the basic principles of current declarative query languages such as SQL, OpenCypher, SPARQL, and XQuery.
    2. Understand why standards make code that uses these languages more portable and prevents lock-in to vendor-specific database features.
    3. Understand the limitations of relational databases and their performance problems when doing large numbers of JOIN operations.
    4. Understand why the labeled-property-graph (LPG) model creates more accurate models of the world where relationships have their own properties.
    5. Understand why the current SQL language does not meet the needs of these LPG databases. 
    6. Be able to describe the LPG data model and how relationships have their own properties. 
    7. Give examples of LPG data models for social networks, retail commerce, banking fraud, and healthcare. 
    8. Describe the key features of GQL, including how queries are created.
    9. Compare and contrast how GQL is similar and different from SQL 
    10. Show that both GQL and SQL have similar support for transactions. 
    11. Compare and contrast how GQL is both similar and different from OpenCypher 
    12. Discuss the new features of GQL 
    13. Discuss how GQL supports advanced pattern matching 
    14. Discuss the limitations of the current version of GQL, including lack of support for constraints, role-based access control for vertices, and lack of support for accumulators
    15. Discuss the need for a new vector-index structure for similarity calculations 
    16. Describe how future AI systems depend on generating precise queries over large world-models 

    Please generate a numbered list of this course's 200 most important concepts. 

    Pay special attention to the order of these concepts, placing foundational concepts first and more advanced concepts last. Try to order the list so concepts later only depend on prior concepts already listed.
