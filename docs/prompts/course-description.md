    You are an expert at helping instructors create a high-quality curriculum and detailed course descriptions that follow the structure of the 2001 Bloom taxonomy to create an ordered
    list of learning objectives. 

    The ISO standards organization just created a new standard for queries on labeled property graphs. This new standard query language is called the "Graph Query Language" or GQL. The full standard is described in ISO/IEC 39075, released in April 2024. 

    I would like to teach a course on GQL but I need your help creating
    a highly detailed course description for this GQL course and in what order they should be taught. 
    
    **Course Description:** "Learning GQL with AI".
    **Audience:** This be taught by computer science and engineering colleges and universities around the world.

    **Prerequisites:** Students must already taken a introduction
    to databases course.  Students should also be familiar with data types such as
    strings, integers, decimals and lists.
    
    Here are some of the goals of this course: 

    1. Understand the basic principles of current declarative query languages such as SQL, OpenCypher, SPARQL, and XQuery.
    2. Understand why standards make code that uses these languages more portable and prevents lock-in to vendor-specific database features.
    3. Understand the limitations of relational databases and their performance problems when doing large numbers of JOIN operations.
    4. Understand why the labeled-property-graph (LPG) model creates more accurate models of the world where relationships have their own properties.
    5. Understand why the current SQL language does not meet the needs of these LPG databases. 
    6. Be able to describe the LPG data model and how relationships have their own properties. 
    7. Give examples of LPG data models for social networks, retail commerce, banking fraud, and healthcare. 
    8. Describe the key features of GQL, including how queries are created.
    9. Compare and contrast how GQL is similar and different from SQL 
    10. Show that both GQL and SQL have similar support for transactions. 
    11. Compare and contrast how GQL is both similar and different from OpenCypher 
    12. Discuss the new features of GQL 
    13. Discuss how GQL supports advanced pattern matching 
    14. Discuss the limitations of the current version of GQL, including lack of support for constraints, role-based access control for vertices, and lack of support for accumulators
    15. Discuss the need for a new vector-index structure for similarity calculations 
    16. Describe how future AI systems depend on generating precise queries over large world-models 

    Please generate a detailed course description that follows the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy guidelines.

### Course Description for "Learning GQL with AI"

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has recently introduced the Graph Query Language (GQL) as a new standard for querying labeled property graphs, detailed in ISO/IEC 39075, released in April 2024. "Learning GQL with AI" is a comprehensive course designed for computer science and engineering students at colleges and universities worldwide. This course equips learners with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilize GQL for querying graph databases, leveraging the structured framework of the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy to progress from foundational understanding to advanced application and critical evaluation. By integrating AI-powered tools, the course enhances the learning experience, providing students with personalized feedback and practical insights into GQL’s role in modern and future technologies.

### Audience
This course targets computer science and engineering students who have completed an introductory database course and are familiar with basic data types such as strings, integers, decimals, and lists. It is tailored to prepare students for academic, research, or industry roles where graph databases and query languages are pivotal.

### Prerequisites
- **Completion of an Introductory Database Course**: Students should have a basic understanding of database concepts, including relational models and querying fundamentals.
- **Familiarity with Basic Data Types**: Knowledge of strings, integers, decimals, and lists is required to engage with GQL syntax and data structures effectively.

### Course Description
"Learning GQL with AI" offers an in-depth exploration of the Graph Query Language (GQL), the latest ISO standard for querying labeled property graphs. Students will develop a thorough understanding of GQL’s foundations, its relationship to other query languages, and its practical applications in real-world scenarios. The course progresses through six carefully structured units, each aligned with the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy levels—Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create—to ensure a logical and comprehensive learning journey. Hands-on exercises, supported by AI tools, enable students to design graph schemas, write optimized queries, and critically assess GQL’s capabilities and limitations. By the end, students will be proficient in GQL and prepared to leverage its potential in graph-based applications, including those intersecting with artificial intelligence.
