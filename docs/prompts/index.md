# Prompts

1. **Course Description** - we usually start with a generic course description as it would appear in a course catalog
2. **Bloom Taxonomy Refinements** - we refine the course description to fit Blooms't taxonomy which starts out with concept definitions and proceeds to creating hands-on skills for creating new content
3. **Concept Enumeration** - create a flat list of about 150 concepts ideally sorted from simple to complex
4. **Concept Dependencies** - for each concept, create a list of what other concepts it depends on
5. **Concept Taxonomy** - for all the concepts, create about ten classifications for all the concepts
6. **Concept Classification** -- for each Concept in the graph, assign it to a primary Taxonomy ID
7. **Content Generation** - once you have your concepts organized, you can then use this knowledge to create various content in different languages
8. **Glossary of Terms** - we can generate an ISO-11179 concept definition for each of the concepts
in our concept graph
